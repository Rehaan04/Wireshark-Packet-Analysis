# Wireshark-Packet-Analysis
This project demonstrates basic hands-on skills with Wireshark including packet capture, filtering, protocol analysis, and export.

# Steps Followed 
1) Installed Wireshark
2) Started capturing traffic for 2 minutes using the active network interface.
3) Applied filters to inspect specific protocols namely TCP,UDP and DNS.
4) Identified multiple protocols in the capture.
5) Exported capture as a '.pcap' file.

# Protocols identified
1) TCP : Transmission Control Protocol for reliable and ordered communication.
2) UDP : User Datagram Protocol for faster but less reliable communication.
3) DNS : Domain Name System which translates human-readable names into IP addresses.

# Outcome 
Gained hands-on packet analysis skills and protocol awareness.
